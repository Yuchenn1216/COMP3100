First-Fit (FF)
Pros:
Simple and easy to implement.
Fast algorithm as it scans the list of available resources and selects the first one that fits the job's requirements.
Cons:
Can lead to fragmentation of resources as it does not consider future requests.
May not be able to find a suitable resource for a job if it is too large to fit in the remaining available space.
Best-Fit (BF)
Pros:
Minimizes fragmentation of resources by selecting the resource that is closest in size to the job's requirements.
Can potentially make more efficient use of available resources compared to FF.
Cons:
More complex than FF as it requires sorting the list of available resources by size before selecting the best fit.
Slower than FF due to the sorting process.
Worst-Fit (WF)
Pros:
Tends to allocate larger resources which can be useful for certain types of jobs.
Can potentially reduce the number of times resources need to be split.
Cons:
Can lead to increased fragmentation of resources as it leaves behind small free areas.
May not be able to find a suitable resource for a job if it is too small to fit in the remaining available space.
